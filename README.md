# GitHub Action to GCS Bucket

This simple action uses the [gsutil tool](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) to sync a directory (either from your repository or generated during your workflow) with a remote Google Cloud Storage bucket

## Usage

### `workflow.yml`

Place in a `.yml` file such as this one in your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

Mostly [`gsutil rsync` flags](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/rsync) are optional to allow for maximum customizability and must be provided by you via `args:`

#### Example

- `-d` mirror source and destination. [See.](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/rsync#using--d-option-with-caution-to-mirror-source-and-destination)

```yaml
name: gcs-sync

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: weslenng/gcs-sync@v1
        with:
          args: -d
        env:
          GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE: ${{ secrets.GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE }}
          GCP_STORAGE_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.GCP_STORAGE_BUCKET }}
          SOURCE_DIR: "public"
```

### Configuration

The following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example. Sensitive information, especially `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE`, should be [set as encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) â€” otherwise, they'll be public to anyone browsing your repository's source code and CI logs

| Key | Value | Suggested Type | Required | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE` | Your JSON GCP service account key file. [More info here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/managing-hmackeys) | `Secret ENV` | **Yes** | N/A |
| `GCP_STORAGE_BUCKET` | Your GCP Storage bucket name For example, `project` | `Secret ENV` | **Yes** | N/A |
| `SOURCE_DIR` | The local directory (or file) you wish to sync/upload to GCP Storage. For example, `public` | `ENV` | **Yes** | N/A |
| `DEST_DIR` | The directory inside of the GCP Storage bucket you wish to sync/upload to. For example, `project/assets`. Defaults to the root of the bucket | `ENV` | No | `/` (root of bucket) |
